## Description
A system that manages employees within an organization.  This application uses the command line, together with Inquirer and MySQL to manage the addition and modification of employee data, role data and departmental data.  When running the application the application will present the users with a series of options including an option to quit the application.  Each option will either respond with the display requested or show additional prompts for greater clarification.  The application makes use of Inquirer to ask and manage the prompts, and MySQL to handle the data requests.  The data is displayed to the user in a table format that is easy for the user to read.  Messages are displayed to user confirming additions and modifications. 


## Usage

Below is a link to the walkthrough video of the working application.
